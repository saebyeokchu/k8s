Sure! Here's a professional and clean `README.md` for your Kubernetes repo at [https://github.com/saebyeokchu/k8s](https://github.com/saebyeokchu/k8s), assuming it's for managing Kubernetes manifests and deployments.

# k8s üê≥üõ†Ô∏è

A personal Kubernetes configuration repository for deploying and managing containerized applications using declarative manifests and Helm charts. This repo reflects my DevOps learning journey, best practices, and experimentation in real-world deployments.

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Declarative YAML manifests for deployments, services, ingress, and configmaps
- ‚úÖ Helm chart usage and customization
- ‚úÖ Namespace-based organization
- ‚úÖ Secrets and sensitive info handled securely (e.g., via SealedSecrets or external tools)
- ‚úÖ Designed for multi-environment use (dev/stage/prod)

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```bash
k8s/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base/               # Common manifests shared across environments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overlays/           # Environment-specific configurations (dev/stage/prod)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stage/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prod/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ charts/             # Custom or third-party Helm charts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üöÄ How to Use

> Prerequisites: `kubectl`, `kustomize`, and/or `helm` installed and configured.

### Apply a manifest (raw YAML)

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./base/deployment.yaml
```

### Use Kustomize

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev
```

### Use Helm

```bash
helm install my-app ./charts/my-app
```

## üîê Secrets Handling

This repo avoids storing raw secrets directly. Consider using tools like:

- [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)
- [External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/)
- GitOps vault integrations (e.g., with ArgoCD or Flux)
